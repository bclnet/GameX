Signed vs. unsigned integers differ in their ability to represent negative numbers: Signed variables use the most significant bit (leftmost) for a sign (+/-), allowing both positive and negative values but with a smaller positive range, while Unsigned variables use all bits for magnitude, meaning they only store zero or positive numbers, giving them double the positive range but no negatives. Unsigned types are great for quantities (like pixel counts) where negatives don't make sense, while signed types are essential for general math.

Big-endian and little-endian describe the order bytes are stored in memory: Big-endian stores the most significant byte (MSB) first like how we write numbers, while little-endian stores the least significant byte (LSB) first, making it seem reversed to humans but efficient for CPUs like Intel. Big-endian is common in networking (network byte order) and older systems, while little-endian dominates modern processors (x86, most ARM) for simpler casts and bit I/O.
