**Game Families: An Evolutionary Approach to Game Development**

Every video game has a universe of its own, but have you ever noticed some familiar elements across different games from the same studio? A certain style of character design, a typical type of texture, or a signature environmental construction? Well, that's the legacy of 'Game Families.'

Game Families is a concept based on the industry practice of grouping specific games by their development studios. This categorization is based on the principle that studios often reuse and recycle the technologies, techniques, and file formats developed for their previous games. It's an evolutionary approach to game development, where each game breeds the next, carrying forward traces of its predecessor within its code and design.

The benefit of understanding Game Families is closely linked to the central theme of this book- the decoding of game file formats. Recognizing the lineage of games allows you to draw connections and make educated guesses about the file structures in newer games from the same studio or 'Family.' These groups showcase shared settings and exhibit small iterations between games, which can vastly simplify the process of decoding the game file formats 

Whether you're venturing into game development or are a curious gamer keen to understand the underpinnings of your favorite games, the concept of Game Families offers fascinating insights into the continuity and progression of game design and technology of your favorite studios.
