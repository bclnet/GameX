When it comes to storing and organizing the vast array of game assets, some video games opt for a proprietary filesystem rather than utilizing common, off-the-shelf filesystem formats. These proprietary filesystem structures are uniquely designed to meet the specific needs of their respective games - whether that's offering a particular format for archived asset storage or enabling the streaming of assets over a network.

Our versatile 'filesys' module is built to manage these complexities seamlessly. With the '*createFileSystem()*' method, you can easily construct a FileSystem object appropriate to your needs, whether that's drawing from the standard operating system filesystem or from a custom-developed filesystem.

The variety of FileSystem classes provided by the module includes:

1. *StandardFileSystem*: This class handles the standard OS filesystem, linking directly to your game's installed location and enabling access to local file assets.

2. *ZipFileSystem*: For games that compact assets into zip files for economic storage and easy distribution, this class gives you a way to access the filesystem within a zip archive.

3. *ZipIsoFileSystem*: A specialized class that aids in accessing filesystems encapsulated in a single ISO file within a zip archive, often seen in games that emulate a CD-ROM structure.

4. *HostFileSystem*: This class deals with network-based filesystems, allowing an app to retrieve and use assets streamed over a network in real-time.

5. *Custom FileSystem*: Some game developers, such as Blizzard, employ their unique filesystem structures. For such cases, we provide the capability to create custom FileSystem classes, like BlizzardFileSystem, tailored to handle these proprietary formats.

This comprehensive suite of options ensures that no matter the format, you have a pathway to access, decode, and manipulate the game assets you need. Our approach is designed to be holistic, bridging the gaps between various filesystems, and providing a unified, understandable means of managing game files across a whole spectrum of games.
