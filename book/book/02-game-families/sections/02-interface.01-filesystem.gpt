Some games use a proprietary filesystem format instead of the normal filesystem.  And we support streamed assets over a network.

The filesys module handles these situations with the createFileSystem() method. This method will return as FileSystem.

* StandardFileSystem - the standard os filesystem
* ZipFileSystem - the filesystem from a zip file
* ZipIsoFileSystem - the filesystem from a zip file containing a single iso file
* HostFileSystem - the network based filesystem
* Custom FileSystem - the custom filesystem for instance BlizzardFileSystem
