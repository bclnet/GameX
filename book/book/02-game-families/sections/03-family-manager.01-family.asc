**Family and JSON Files: Archiving Game Data**

Akin to a family tree, each 'Game Family' is associated with a specific JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) file. This file serves as a neon signpost, marking and mapping out the intricate network of game assets related to that particular family.

The JSON file contains the 'Family' information along with other specific elements such as the game engine details, the games included in the family, and information about the file manager used by the family. This kind of structured data simplifies the process of gathering information about a 'Family', making it easy to understand and access specific game assets.

One unique attribute in these JSON files is the game ID. A game ID that starts with an asterisk (*) is recognized as the default game entry of that 'Family'. This could be considered the 'progenitor' game of the family, from which other games may have evolved. As such, when certain attributes are missing in related games, they are read from this default game entry, ensuring data continuity and integrity.

The interplay between the 'Family' object and its corresponding JSON file underscores the organized architecture of our game asset management system. By pre-emptively filling gaps with default entries and archiving essential details, these JSON files pave the way for a seamless and user-friendly exploration of game assets. This, in turn, aids the process of decoding, repurposing, and utilizing these assets in creative gaming projects.
