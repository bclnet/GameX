In this chapter on store managers, we explored the pivotal role of store managers in managing and locating game assets for specific game developers. These store managers, such as Ubisoft Connect, Battle.net, Epic Games Launcher, GOG Galaxy, and Steam, are dedicated platforms for managing games from respective developers. The process involves locating specific files within these store managers' directories and decoding them to access critical information like installed game locations. By utilizing different decoding methods like ProtoBuf, JSON, and Sqlite3, game developers can efficiently manage and access game assets across various platforms. Understanding the functionalities and mechanisms of store managers is essential for digital creators to effectively navigate and utilize game assets in their development projects, ensuring seamless integration and optimal gaming experiences.
