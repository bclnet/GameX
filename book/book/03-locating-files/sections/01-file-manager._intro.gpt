Rewrite the following paragraph:

A File Manager centralizes file information like Paths, Ignores, and Filters.

Paths are located in the game folders by looking in specific directories, the existing store managers or the windows registry.

    * getPathByDirectory
    Searches for the game in the game specified folder(s) located in the /Games folder.

    * getPathByStoreKey
    Searches for the game in the game specified store manager(s) using the following store managers:
        Blizzard Store Manager
        Epic Store Manager
        Gog Store Manager
        Steam Store Manager

    * getPathByRegistry Key
    Search for the game using the specified registry key(s) in the Windows Registry under the following locations:
        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE
        KEY_CURRENT_USER/SOFTWARE
        HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT/VirtualStore/MACHINE/SOFTWARE
    Once a registry key is found a directory is attempted to be located by searching the following registry key values:
        Path
        Install Dir
        InstallDir
        InstallLocation
    Or getting the directory location from the file set in the following values:
        Installed Path
        ExePath
        Exe

Some games start in a sub-folder of the root game folder, a game can specify additional path(s) which are combined with initially found root folder.
