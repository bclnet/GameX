Battle.net serves as the designated store manager for all Blizzard Entertainment's games portfolio. Under the guiding hands of the Blizzard Store Manager, the 'product.db' file—centrally situated within the store manager's directory—is discovered and deciphered. This process is propelled by Google's Protocol Buffers technology, widely recognized as ProtoBuf. Browsing through the decoded data, we pinpoint the 'ProductInstall:Settings.InstallPath' field which reveals the installation location of the desired game.
