GOG Galaxy functions as the official store manager for all games from GOG.com. Steering this journey is the Gog Store Manager, which traces the 'galaxy-2.0.db' file nestled within the store manager's directory. Utilizing Sqlite3, this file is subsequently decoded. In the labyrinth of decoded data, the specific Sqlite3 query 'SELECT productId, installationPath FROM InstalledBaseProducts' provides the crucial details of the game's installed location on your system.
