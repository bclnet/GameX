Steam serves as the designated store manager for all Steam games. The Steam Store Manager identifies the 'libraryfolders.vdf' file within the manager's directory. This file is decoded using the 'AcfStruct' encoding, where the 'path' field locates the other 'appmanifest_{appId}.acf' files. These files are subsequently decoded using the 'AcfStruct' encoding, with the 'AppState.installdir' field indicating the location of the installed games.
