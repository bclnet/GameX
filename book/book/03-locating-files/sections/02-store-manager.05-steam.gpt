Rewrite the following paragraph:

Steam is the the store manager used for all Steam games.
The Steam Store Manager locates the 'libraryfolders.vdf' file located in the managers directory.
The file is decoded using the 'AcfStruct' encoding with the 'path' field locating the other 'appmanifest_{appId}.acf' files.
These files are then decoded using the 'AcfStruct' encoding with the 'AppState.installdir' field holding the installed games location.
