=== Unity Family

Unity is a cross-platform game engine developed by Unity Technologies, first announced and released in June 2005 at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference as a Mac OS X game engine. The engine has since been gradually extended to support a variety of desktop, mobile, console, augmented reality, and virtual reality platforms. It is particularly popular for iOS and Android mobile game development, is considered easy to use for beginner developers, and is popular for indie game development.

The engine can be used to create three-dimensional (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) games, as well as interactive simulations. The engine has been adopted by industries outside video gaming including film, automotive, architecture, engineering, construction, and the United States Armed Forces.
