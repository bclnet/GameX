Rewrite the following paragraph:

A File Manager centralizes file information like Paths, Ignores, and Filters.

Paths are located in the game folders by looking in specific directories, the existing store managers or the windows registry.

    * getPathByDirectory
    Searches for the game in the game specified folder(s) located in the /Games folder.

    * getPathByStoreKey
    Searches for the game in the game specified store manager(s) using the following store managers:
        Blizzard Store Manager
        Epic Store Manager
        Gog Store Manager
        Steam Store Manager



Some games start in a sub-folder of the root game folder, a game can specify additional path(s) which are combined with initially found root folder.
