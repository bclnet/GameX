// exits early relective, illustation
// emittive, raterization

the topic of photography is vast, we will not be talking about reflective color or using illustration for mathematical precision, instead we will be focusing on reflective colors as presented from a montor and rasterization using pixels.


In relective colors, any color can be represented by the combination of red, blue and green.

A photo or image can be quantizied down to series of tiny dots of color that we call pixles.

If a black and white image of dimentions 10 by 10 pixles uses a byte per pixel to prepresent its shade, that image would take 10 times 10 bytes or 1000 bytes.

To access the pixel at location x,ym you could use the formula of: pxiel = x + width * y; or pixel = x + 10 * y in this example.

However if you hada. 100x100 pixel image and was placing a 10x10 image within it, the formula would be x + 100 * y. even tho the width of the inner image is 10. therefor we use the word Pitch instead of Width.

Pitch is the amount to add to get to the next row.
